# insurance-app
Demonstration of an application that exists in my imagination but could actually exist through collaborative efforts.

Dental offices spend countless hours per week on the phone calling dental insurance companies trying to locate simple benefit coverages so that they can see patients and have accurate billing. This prototype was inspired by a paper form I found at an office, and the office wanted to have the data available in this program at the bare minimum to setup a patient's billing profile. The program is capable of expanding data offered at-a-glance to offices, e.g. more dates of service histories, coverage percentages, etc. or become a full-fledged breakdown of benefits.

Not only do dental offices spend precious time on the phone hunting down benefits for patients, patients often present to offices not knowing who their dental insurance company is. Using an SSN, the database is able to locate the patient and provide details about their plan, history of services, and their dependents data. If a patient knows their Subscriber ID but wants to know about coverage, as these queries come up often in practice, the office staff can enter the Subscriber ID and retrieve the patient that way.

Real-life data could populate this application and make it into so much more. I envision the real-life application would keep the database current with API calls, but for now, I have allowed plans to be uploaded manually via .JSON files.
